Excited to announce a new research collaboration with the **AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC)** on *multimodal alignment and hallucination reduction in Vision–Language Models (VLMs)*.  

Our team will focus on developing **robust benchmarking frameworks** for evaluating spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities in modern VLMs, building upon our previous works *SpatiaLab* and *TimeSpot*.  

Stay tuned for dataset releases and preprints in the coming months!
