Submitted two papers to *ICLR 2026* — one on **Geo-Temporal Reasoning** (*as co-lead author*) and another on **Spatial Reasoning in Vision–Language Models** (*as co-author*) — in collaboration with **Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)** and **CIOL**.  
These works explore **robust multimodal understanding** and **contextual reasoning** in large-scale foundation models.
