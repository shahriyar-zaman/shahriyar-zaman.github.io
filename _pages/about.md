Hi ðŸ‘‹! My research focuses on **visionâ€“language reasoning**, **geo-temporal understanding**, and **ethical NLP**â€”with an emphasis on trustworthy, culturally aware evaluation. Iâ€™m especially interested in **multimodal reasoning**, **adversarial attacks** and **specially designed defense mechanisms** for **autoregressive models**, **trustworthy NLP**, and **computational social systems**.

Currently, Iâ€™m a **Lab Instructor** in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at **[North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/)** and a **Research Intern**(Remote) at the **[AIISC](https://aiisc.ai/)**, University of South Carolina (USA), collaborating with **[Dr. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en)** on adversarial robustness. I also collaborate on **geo-temporal and geospatial understanding** with **[Dr. Md. Rizwan Parvez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KhC8rtcAAAAJ&hl=en)**, Research Scientist at **Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)**. Previously, I worked with **[Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pe8C-SUAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Dr. Nabeel Mohammad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w5djOYsAAAAJ&hl=en)** on visionâ€“language reasoning at North South University, co-leading an **EMNLP 2025 Industry Track** paper. My work has appeared at **EMNLP**, **IEEE BigData**, and **IEEE IS**, and I served as a **reviewer** for the **ACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2025**.

I graduated **summa cum laude (top 2%)** in Computer Science & Engineering from **[North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/)** and received a **Best Paper Award** at **IEEE IS 2024** (Varna, Bulgaria).

Iâ€™m **open to PhD opportunities for Fall 2026**â€”especially in labs working on **robust multimodal reasoning**, **evaluation datasets/tooling**, and **culturally aligned AI, safety, and security**.
