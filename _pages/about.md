Hi! My research is centered on trustworthy evaluation and robustness of foundation models, spanning **vision–language reasoning**, **geo-temporal and geospatial understanding**, and **ethical NLP**.

[1] <u><strong>Vision–language reasoning, multimodal evaluation, and geo-temporal understanding</strong></u>, to build diagnostic benchmarks and reliable evaluation protocols that measure grounded spatial, temporal, and geo-temporal inference under realistic conditions and distinguish genuine reasoning from shortcut learning.

[2] <u><strong>Adversarial robustness and defense mechanisms for autoregressive foundation models</strong></u>, to study failure modes under distribution shift and adversarial attacks, and to design lightweight, principled defenses that improve reliability, uncertainty-awareness, and safety in real-world deployments.

[3] <u><strong>Culturally grounded ethical NLP, bias, and computational social systems</strong></u>, to analyze norm-sensitive errors and social bias in low-resource and multicultural settings, and to develop culturally aligned datasets and evaluation methods that support fair, accountable, and socially grounded AI behavior.

I graduated **summa cum laude (top 2%)** in Computer Science & Engineering from **[North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/)**. Currently, I am a **Lab Instructor** in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at **[North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/)** and a **Research Intern (Remote)** at the **[AIISC](https://aiisc.ai/)**, University of South Carolina (USA), collaborating with **[Dr. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en)** on adversarial robustness. I also collaborate on **geo-temporal and geospatial understanding** of foundation models with **[Dr. Md. Rizwan Parvez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KhC8rtcAAAAJ&hl=en)**, Research Scientist at the **Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)**. Previously, I worked with **[Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pe8C-SUAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Dr. Nabeel Mohammad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w5djOYsAAAAJ&hl=en)** on vision–language reasoning at North South University, co-leading an **EMNLP 2025 Industry Track** paper. My work has been **published** at **ICLR**, **EMNLP**, **IEEE BigData**, and **IEEE IS (Best Paper Award)**, and I served as a **reviewer** for the **ACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2025**.

<u><strong>I am actively seeking a PhD/MS position starting in Fall 2026.</strong></u>
